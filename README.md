### Description of Idea
## Problem

- The unskilled in our country is not getting the pay he deserves. Most of the money they are earning is grabbed up by the middle men.
- They have no choice in the job they are accepting.

## Idea : A web app that aims at solving this problem in a way never implemented never before

We Aim at giving the job control to the worker instead of the organization and the option to select .

Now everything is transparent and can be seen from both ends , open ends , open database visible from both sides , no sense of superiority of the job provider .

The mere fact that we connect the job seekers to the job providers openly and without any tampering makes our project standout.

We aim at building a one to one system where one person will be able to accomplish his/her daily tasks just by reaching our website.
